## What is Illusion?
Illusion is an opinionated, mobile-first, progressive enhanced, accessible, SCSS base kit to kickstart websites with and helps you keep a maintainable SCSS code base.

Illusion is built to be used on top of <a href="#">Modernizr</a> and <a href="#">Normalize</a>. When included, Illusion does nothing. Enable features by <a href="#">setting SCSS variables</a> or using mixins.

Illusion let's you write consistent and clean code in less time. Based on an 8 point grid for harmonized design. Illusion is a combination of modern web-design philosophies, base styling and a mixin library.
